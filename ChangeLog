	* Databases with package dependencies now require DB version 10 as they will
	  use a different dependency list structure.
	* C API started
	* libpkgdepdb started

2014-10-01 Blub

	* pkgdepdb namespace; header split; cleanups

2014-08-28 Blub

	* -fcontains

2014-07-12 Blub (0.1.8)

	* released

2014-07-10 Blub

	* database bump: 9
	* storing ELF interpreter data
	* added filters for rpath/runpath/interpreter in the variants -flib
	  and -fpkglib
	* -flibrpath, -flibrunpath, -flibinterp

2014-05-17 Blub

	* integrity check now goes through package replacements

2014-05-03 Blub

	* fix uninitialized refcount_ member
	* convention change: refcount_ members now get an '= 0' in class-defs
		rather than being explicitly initialized in constructors
	* Releasing 0.1.7.1 as hotfix

2014-05-02 Blub

	* fix accidental removal of -flib* filters

2014-04-27 Blub

	* buildfix for 32 bit
	* refactoring and slight speed improvements

2014-02-16 Blub

	* bugfix: --relink didn't properly clear the missing/found sets

2013-12-23 Blub

	* database bump: 8
		OBJREF and PKGREF entries now don't use arbitrary numbers, but represent
		the object's "index". The first object written out has index 0, the second
		index 1 and so on. This avoids lookups in std::maps.
	* more read/write efficient database layout:
		The required_found and required_missing map<>s have been removed. Since
		they mapped each object to one set, this set is now stored in the objects
		itself. This makes install/remove a tiny bit slower, but barely noticable
		and worth the gain. Additionally some deduping and cleanup happened in the
		related areas.
	* --touch option
	* bugfix: fixed some uses of std::remove

2013-12-01 Blub

	* pkglibdepends filter:
		-fpkglibdepends: filter packages which contain libraries
		which match -flibdepends with the provided pattern.

2013-11-28 Blub

	* ~/.config/pgkdepdb now supersedes ~/.pkgdepdb

2013-11-22 Blub

	* database bump: 7
		now optionally contains a list of files of each package
	* new query: filelist
		--ls now queries files
	* new filter: filename filter for filelist queries
		-ffile
	* action: --rm-files - remove contained filelists

2013-11-16 Blub

	* filter added: libpath
	* bugfix: fix parsing of regex filter commandlines

2013-11-09 Blub

	* more package filters:
		optdepends, alldepends, provides, conflicts, replaces

2013-11-05 Blub

	* database writing: fix: added missing open mode
	* database bump: 6
		db now contains a list of to-be-assumed-found libs

2013-11-02 Blub

	* filter support:
		-f filters -fname= -fname: -fname/regex/
		And negation by prefixing with a !
		group filters added
		added -fbroken
	* bug fixes:
		fixed segfault (null deref) when the db file cannot be opened

2013-10-22 Blub

	* file locking: Replaced O_EXLOCK with calls to flock(2)
	* database format 5:
		Packages now store the list of groups they're part of.

2013-08-05 Blub

	* --integrity: don't show missing / conflicting  package  messages
		multiple times

2013-08-04 Blub (0.1.3)

	* Released

2013-08-04 Blub

	* --wipe: added option to remove all packages
	* libalpm support: integrity checks will use libalpm's vercmp
	* --integrity: dependency and conflict integrity checks added

2013-07-28 Blub

	* -Rstrict:
		Database has a strict flag now.  Will later be used to  change
		how to treat osabi values set to 0.
	* 'josn' config typo fixed:
		In the config file, 'json' was not recognized, as there was  a
		typo making it 'josn', for now both will  be  recognized,  but
		the typo is deprecated (for obvious reasons...)

2013-07-15 Blub

	* -Rpkg-ld-append, --ld-append:
		Fixed bug: append inserted before the last element...   *sigh*

2013-07-09 Blub (0.1.2)

	* Released

2013-07-09 Blub

	* database format change:
		Added a bitfield to mask rules and library paths from being to
		the database.  Writing a database with no  rule  entries  will
		cause version 1 to be used.
	* configuration file:
		will now look  for  config  files  ~/.pkgdepdb/config  or  for
		pkgdepdb.conf in $(SYSCONFDIR)
	* package dependency tracking:
		Now also reading depend= and optdepend= entries from  .PKGINFO
		files.  Databases with package-dependency info  will  use  the
		database format version 3 as it modifies the way packages  are
		serialized.
		Dependency tracking can be enabled or disabled in  the  config
		or via the --depends commandline switch.
	* base package list:
		A list of base packages can be created which contains  a  list
		of packages which will be  assumed  installed  during  package
		aware dependency checks.
	* json option:
		--json or -J now take a parameter specifying where json format
		is supposed to be used.

2013-07-08 Blub

	* queries/json:
		json formatted output for all queries for the sake of
		machine readability.
	* options: -q to raise the LogLevel to Print
	* database version 2:
		contains per-package library paths and a list of files
		which are to be ignored at link-time.
	* rules:
		-R / --rule takes a rule command to modify rules like
		file-ignores or package library paths.
	* path strings:
		path strings in rules or --ld parameters now get sanitized

2013-07-07 Blub

	* db.cpp: -L shows rpath and runpath with a single -v now
	* elf.cpp: pathlists are now handled differently, prevous
	           path fixes may have broken rpath/runpath entries
	           so please rebuild your databases...
	* more: added a filter for -P to show only broken packages:
	        --broken. Verbosity levels affect the output.

2013-07-06 Blub (0.1.1 hotfix release)

	* --fixpaths
	* handling of .. and . in paths at load-time and via --fixpaths

2013-07-06 Blub (0.1)

	* first release of database management
